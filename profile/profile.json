  "summary": "My name is Anita Mathews and I graduated in November 2020 with my M.Sc. in Physics and Astronomy from McMaster University. My M.Sc. thesis involved developing a method in Python to incorporate observational data into a star cluster simulation and analyzing the results. Prior to that, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Waterloo and have completed some undergraduate coop terms related to 3D printing and particle physics. My coding experiences in science have sparked my interest in pursuing a career in software as I enjoy developing creative solutions to problems, learning new technologies and collaborating with others."
