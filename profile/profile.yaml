# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: My name is Anita Mathews and I graduated in November 2020 with my M.Sc. in Physics and Astronomy from McMaster University. My M.Sc. thesis involved developing a method in Python to incorporate observational data into a star cluster simulation and analyzing the results. Prior to that, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Waterloo and have completed some undergraduate coop terms related to 3D printing and particle physics. My coding experiences in science have sparked my interest in pursuing a career in software as I enjoy developing creative solutions to problems, learning new technologies and collaborating with others.

    description: "Provisioned a postgreSQL database using Docker on a Linux VM hosted on GCP. Programmed bash scripts to extract hardware specifications and resource usage data and insert data into database. Used crontab to record resource data every minute and tested results by performing SQL queries on the database. Used git during the development process and saved source code to GitHub."

    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Grep App: Implemented an app in Java that mimics that Linux grep command. Wrote unit tests using JUnit and used the Stream API to optimize memory usage. Built a Docker Image and pushed image to Docker Hub where it can be pulled and run."
      - "JDBC App: Implemented an app in Java that uses JDBC to execute queries on a database using the DAO pattern."
      - "Twitter App: Implemented an app in Java that can create, read and delete Tweets from the CLI using the Twitter REST API. Developed the app using several layers including a controller layer, service layer and a data access object layer. Performed unit and integration testing using JUnit and Mockito and packaged app using Maven. Built a Docker image and pushed to Docker Hub."
