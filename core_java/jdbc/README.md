# Introduction
The purpose of this application is to utilize the JDBC API in Java in order to execute queries on a database. The JDBC API handles connections to RDBMS databases, executes queries written using SQL strings and can manage result sets that are retrieved from the databases. A PostgreSQL database is provisioned using Docker and is populated with data in several tables. Through this Java app (that is built with Maven), queries can be executed on this database which include inserting into tables, updating records and deleting records. As well, the result sets can be iterated over in order to examine them. 

# Implementation
## ER Diagram
ER diagram - get this from DBeaver

## Design Patterns
Discuss DAO and Repository design patterns (150-200 words)

# Test
How you test your app against the database? (e.g. database setup, test data set up, query result)

(testing for each use case - create, read, update and delete.

put the driver code for each case here)
